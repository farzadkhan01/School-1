                            <p>Creativity is one of the important principles of early childhood education and care for
                                children’s development of cognitive, social, and emotional. In a rapidly emerging
                                knowledge base, creativity helps children discover concepts they are interested in, give
                                vent to their emotions or feelings and experience and test their environment (Berk,
                                2018). This website aims at availing resource and implementation technique to teachers
                                in tackling creativity in curriculum and subject areas in early childhood learning.

                            <h2> Why Creativity Matters:</h2>
                            <p>Cognitive Development: Creativity call for improvement of evoked cognitive abilities
                                including of problem solving and critical thinking. For imagination is the best tool
                                that,
                                during the play, enhances children’s thinking abilities to deal with abstract concepts
                                and
                                analyze the complexity of their problems (Gopnik, 2017). Such activities foster
                                creativity
                                and cognitive flexibility that is the ability of a child to change the mode of operation
                                of
                                his or her brain and adapt well in circumstances (Berk, 2018). </p>

                            <h2> Emotional Expression: </h2>
                            <p>Creativity on the part of children is helpful since it provides an avenue of expressing
                                feelings. To this effect, artistic and dramatic activities serve as an enabling tool for
                                children to express their emotional status hence leading to the preschooler’s regulation
                                of the feelings, especially frustration (Berk, 2018). The creative activity would also
                                help a child to make sense of things or feelings within expressive-self as children
                                would discover the inner aspect of them </p>

                    <div class="separate-catigory">
                        <h2> Social Skills: </h2>
                        <p>Creativity related tasks have social relationships and team working embedded within them.
                            Collaborative projects and group projects force the participants to have to communicate and
                            work together as well as understand the feelings of others. In frolic play, the children get
                            to be in a position to arrange as well as coordinate, share knowledge and ideas as well as
                            encourage team members, which are pivotal skills for beneficial social relations (Vygotsky,
                            1978).

                            <p>It was seen that art education plays a vital role in the education of early childhood
                                children especially in developing their creativity. It offers children with chance to
                                come up with their creations and to explore the affective domain through media. Arts
                                education boosts the use of the hands and brains, problem-solving skills, and over-all
                                learning (Eisner 2002; Gallagher 2019).</p>

                            <p>Some of the requirements that help make art include paint, brushes, clay, markers as well
                                as different types of papers. It is also possible to use fabric or sand paper or even
                                aluminum foil to help a child see different textures in making pieces of art (Koster,
                                2009).
                                Digital Tools: Drawing Applications and software in the digital environment gives
                                children another platform through which to explore artmaking with fresh media that can
                                enrich the possibilities offered by materials that would traditionally be used (Gallas,
                                1994).

                            <h2> Pedagogical Practices: </h2>
                            <p> Open-Ended Projects: Make the alternatives for children to be able to do more open-ended
                                art projects that would foster a creative mind and free thinking. Such project enable
                                children to have voice and make decisions regarding their projects hence enhancing
                                freedom and creativity (Vygotsky, 1978).
                                Thematic Exploration: Engage children in learning through art by choosing certain topics
                                as seasons, cultures or kinds of emotions. This approach assists children to establish
                                relationships between the concepts created and the goals of learning hence improving on
                                their knowledge of different areas (Eisner, 2002).

                        <h2> Learning Experiences: </h2>
                        <p>0-2 Years: Sensory painting activities inclusive of edible colors and textured objects helps
                            the infants in touch and vision senses. This activity is beneficial to the sensory
                            development as well as the early art experience for the child (Fisher, 2011).
                            2-3 Years: Manipulating collages with different textures of pieces of material, you can
                            improve the use of fingers in babies, and invention. As the child combines the different
                            materials, the child gets to know their area of interest in arts while at the same time
                            improving their spacial awareness (Hargreaves, 2009).
                            3-5 Years: Solving a task by creating animals or landscapes with them out of various
                            elements stimulates the child’s imagination and helps the child to learn problem-solving
                            skills. These topics can easily be fit into other learning areas so that art links with
                            different areas of study (Golub, 2004).
                            6-8 Years: In turn, such advanced forms of art as printmaking facilitate children deeper
                            engagement in artistic practices. Printmaking activities, as one of the arts teaching
                            strategies, enable children to appreciate notions such as texture, pattern and composition
                            (Bresler, 2006).

                                and emotional skills of the child. The activities facilitate access to the diverse
                                viewpoints and also the emotions are depicted by feelings through role play and
                                storytelling (O’Neill, 1995; Boal, 2002). </p>

                            <p>The dramatic play requires the use of puppets, costumes, and props in order to make the
                                learning fun. These assist children to role-play and get to experience sampling
                                different characters and events (Johnson & O’Neill, 1984).

                            <p> Besides, there are applications which allow children to perform puppetry and use other
                                online resources related to drama. These sorts of tools may extend more conventional
                                forms of puppet workshops and performances and open up new possibilities for play
                                (Heathcote & Bolton, 1995).

                        <h2> Learning Experiences: </h2>
                        <p>0-2 Years: Sensory painting activities inclusive of edible colors and textured objects helps
                            the infants in touch and vision senses. This activity is beneficial to the sensory
                            development as well as the early art experience for the child (Fisher, 2011).
                            2-3 Years: Manipulating collages with different textures of pieces of material, you can
                            improve the use of fingers in babies, and invention. As the child combines the different
                            materials, the child gets to know their area of interest in arts while at the same time
                            improving their spacial awareness (Hargreaves, 2009).
                            3-5 Years: Solving a task by creating animals or landscapes with them out of various
                            elements stimulates the child’s imagination and helps the child to learn problem-solving
                            skills. These topics can easily be fit into other learning areas so that art links with
                            different areas of study (Golub, 2004).
                            6-8 Years: In turn, such advanced forms of art as printmaking facilitate children deeper
                            engagement in artistic practices. Printmaking activities, as one of the arts teaching
                            strategies, enable children to appreciate notions such as texture, pattern and composition
                            (Bresler, 2006).
                            0-2 Years: Infants are familiarized with rudimentary ideas of dramatic play and social
                            communication by basic puppet show for babies. Some of them include: The use of soft
                            textured puppets, which can enable the caregivers to engage the infants in storytelling as
                            well as educating the infants about the various textures when taken through exploration
                            (Newman & Simoes, 2017).
                            2-3 Years: Performing basic storytelling that uses content appropriate to children and
                            involves the use of different forms of prop and puppets makes toddlers to be better in
                            language and social development. It makes the childhood development more interactive mostly
                            because it entails a lot of acting and storytelling (Woodson 2014).
                            3-5 Years: Engaging in early learners in the production of the mannered play scenarios and
                            performance helps the learners gain confidence and improve on collaboration skills. All of
                            these activities help children to develop such skills as roleplay, decision making and
                            emotional regulation (Keller, 2018).
                            6-8 Years: Dramatization helps the child, especially the elder, to be in a position to
                            understand and act on presented narrative and themes on a play. This activity hone the
                            creative skills, group working and presentation skills of the students, besides acquainting
                            them with the aspect of dramatic narration (Thompson 2009).
